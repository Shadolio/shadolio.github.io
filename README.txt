Just a fun little profile/card-style template I whipped up during a break between major
projects. Minimal, responsive, and powered by Skel + Sass. Enjoy :)

[19/05/2019] Shadi Barghash:

	- Font Awesome (free) version upgraded to version 5.8.2, and accordingly,
		- font-awesome.min.css and references to it in the index.html and main.css were deleted, and replaced by references to fontawesome.min.css (the new version) solid.min.css and brands.min.css;
		- old "fonts" folder was deleted, and "webfonts" folder was added; and,
		- in main.css, styles that referenced FontAwesome as its font-family were updated, so that either font-family is now "Font Awesome 5 Free" and the font-weight is set to 400 or 900, or font-family and font-weight were both removed.

	- HTML tag was updated in index.html to contain 'dir' and 'lang' attributes for this web page.
	- meta tags were added to the <head> of the index.html page, to contain author information, description and keywords.
